<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sam Clift. I was born in 1998 in Dallas, Texas and have lived here most of my life. I graduated from Lake
  Highlands High School in 2017 and graduated from Austin College up in Sherman, Texas in 2021 with a Bachelor of Art
  in History and a minor in Art. I was also a member of the tennis team in high school.</p>

<p>I don't have too many hobbies, but among other things I enjoy going on walks, running, drawing, reading, and, as of recent,
  software development. As a longtime regular Internet user, it's satisfying to now be seeing the other end of it all. Some
  of my favorite subjects are history, current events, and, to a lesser degree, philosophy. I also have a strong interest
  in animals.</p>

<p>My favorite form of entertainment is probably YouTube, though it's always a pleasure to watch the occasional TV show as
  well. I like food shows as well as anything with a strong paranormal theme. I love many genres of movies, but I especially
  like period pieces.</p>
